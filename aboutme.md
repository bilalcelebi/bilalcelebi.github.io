Hi, I'm Bilal a.k.a Satrayn. Satrayn means nothing, I mean really nothing.
I'm using it because It sounds good to me when someone say it. 
But all words actually mean nothing, right? We are that give them a mean or value. Too much philosophy so never mind.

learning topics and I will explaining detailed my works and toughts.
Here some topics that I'm trying the work on. Machine Learning, Model Fine-Tuning, Data Analysis and Information Extraction from Data. Web Development and Little Styling with CSS/Tailwind and React/Next. And some theorical sciences that I'm loving the read about like Sociolgy, Anthropolgy, Socail Pyschology, Human Behaviour Interpration. And also I'm loving the mixing the disciplines like Marketing-Deep Learning, Programming-Finance. I'm gonna try doing all of this stuffs and trying the tell you in here.
