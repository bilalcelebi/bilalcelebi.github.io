## Now I'm Gonna Tell you Why I created This Blog.


A few weeks ago, I decided to enter a serial work cycle on behalf of my plans for the next 6 months. And of course I wanted something to hide and present everything I've done during this time. This is the main reason why I opened this place. Another reason is the permanence of the text. I will continue this for years to come. I will write down everything I learn. Even if I forget it myself, it will be enough for me to come here and repeat it. This is my warehouse
and it will be like my flipchart.

Here, in addition to dealing with topics, I will also mainly present my projects. Data analysis and evaluations I have done. Machine Learning projects, my Web Development projects, and more. Since I will be interested in social sciences as well as technical and engineering, I will present my ideas that I have developed as a mixed discipline as an article.

Sometimes, there will be projects that I prepare by mixing many disciplines together and blending them. These projects are as precious as diamonds to me because each discipline is a piece of itself.
It strengthens the idea while at the same time making it more detailed and safe and unique.

The essence of the short story. I will tell you everything here. Including all my work, projects and deeply thoughts.
