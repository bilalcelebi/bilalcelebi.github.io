### I Predicted House Prices ###

I predicted house prices by dependant variables like How big of House or Neighborhood of house. Here ise the my Kaggle Notebook.

Firstly, I cleaned my data from null columns and encode categorical variables with ***LabelEncoder*** than maked a model with ***LinearRegressor*** (I will try the other models too) after fitting my model with training data I encoded my test data and predicted test data ***SalePrice*** columns that mean Price of Home.
